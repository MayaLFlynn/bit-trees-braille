## Lab Bit Braille Trees

BrailleASCII gives a way for the user to interact with converting bit braille strings into ASCII strings, bit braille strings into unicode, or ASCII into bit braille strings
BitTree implements a binary tree that is specfic to the use of finding the bit braille strings for BrailleASCII

Acknoledgements:
Professor Rebelsky provided a class that I took inspiration for to convert unicode strings to unicode characters
Diogo tried to help me figure out why my dump method wasn't working.
